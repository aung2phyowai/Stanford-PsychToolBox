% BISBAS - Behavioral Inhibition System /  Behavioral Approach System
% ---------------------------------
% presents the BIS/BAS scales, collects answers
% usage: [BASDrive, BASFS, BASRewRes, BIS, rating] = BISBAS(c)
%
% arguments:
%   c -- see exptSetup
%
% output:
%
%   BASDrive   -- subscore for drive
%   BASFS   -- subscore for fun seeking
%   BASRewRes -- subscore for reward responsiveness
%   rating -- raw ratings (the numbers they chose for each)
